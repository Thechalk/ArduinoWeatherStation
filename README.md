# ArduinoWeatherStation

This is the code for an **Arduino Weather Station** using these external components :
- A gps *NEO-6m*
- A MicroSD card adapter
- A barometric Sensor *GY-68*
- An LCD screen 16x2

<u>Here's how it works :</u>
It picks up *date, hour, altitude, longitude, latitude* from the gps and *altitude, air pressure, temperature* from the barometric sensor
