# ArduinoWeatherStation

This is the code for an **Arduino Weather Station** using these external components :
- A gps *NEO-6m*
- A MicroSD card adapter
- A barometric Sensor *GY-68*
- An LCD screen 16x2



*Here's how it works :*
It picks up ***date, hour, altitude, longitude, latitude*** from the gps and ***altitude, air pressure, temperature*** from the barometric sensor
